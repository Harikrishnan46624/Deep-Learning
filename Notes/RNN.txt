Advantages of RNNs:
Handle sequential data effectively, including text, speech, and time series.
Process inputs of any length, unlike feedforward neural networks.
Share weights across time steps, enhancing training efficiency

Disadvantages of RNNs:
Prone to vanishing and exploding gradient problems, hindering learning.
Training can be challenging, especially for long sequences.
Computationally slower than other neural network architectures
