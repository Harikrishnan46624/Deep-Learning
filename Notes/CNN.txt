CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network specifically designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images and videos. It's a class of artificial neural networks that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks.

Why
Traditional neural networks struggle with image data due to their large size and the spatial relationships present in images. CNNs were developed to address these challenges by leveraging the local connectivity pattern inspired by the visual cortex of animals.

Convolutional Layer:
The core building block involves applying convolutional filters or kernels to the input data to extract local patterns. This helps in capturing hierarchical features.

Feature Maps: The output of the convolution operation is known as a feature map, highlighting the presence of specific features in the input

filter or kernel
small matrix used for convolution operations. Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function.In CNNs, convolution involves sliding a filter/kernel over the input data (image or feature map) to perform local operations.


PADDING
Padding is the process of adding extra pixels or values around the input data, usually zeros, before applying a convolution operation. It helps to preserve spatial information and mitigate issues at the borders of the input image.

Types
Valid (No Padding), Same (Zero Padding)

STRIDE
Stride in Convolutional Neural Network defines the number of pixels we want to skip or move while performing Convolution Operation in CNN.

Types of Stride:
Unit Stride: The filter moves one pixel at a time.
Strided Convolution: The filter skips pixels as it moves, taking steps of more than one pixel at a time

Pooling
Pooling is a downsampling operation applied to feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions and computational complexity
and controlling overfitting

Max Pooling:
Operation: Takes the maximum value from a set of values in a region of the feature map.
Purpose: Retains the most prominent feature in each region

Average Pooling:
Operation: Takes the average value from a set of values in a region of the feature map.
Purpose: Provides a smoothed representation of the features in each region.

Purpose of Pooling:
Downsampling: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, aiding in computational efficiency and reducing overfitting.

RELU - helps cnn stay mathematically healthy by keeping learned values from getting stuck newar 0 or blowing up toward infinity used as the activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
