Data Augmentation: 
Technique involving random transformations on the input data, such as rotation, flipping, and scaling, to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization.

Transfer Learning: 
Leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, which is especially useful when working with limited labeled data.
